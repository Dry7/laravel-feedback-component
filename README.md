[TL;DR. Installation](#install)

## Introduction

Laravel Kustomer allows you to easily implement a Customer Feedback component on your website. It is build with VueJS but can be implemented in any kind of Laravel Project. You just need to drop a few lines in your layout.

You probably know a lot of website that use intercom's chatting system, or crisp, chat.io and many more customer chat allowing you to get feedbacks from your website visitors.

Laravel Kustomer is an open-source and customizable alternative that adopts the same layout. Once installed, you will see on your website a floating bubbble.

### Chatting System

I'll work on implementing a chatting system in Laravel Kustomer, that will probably work with Laravel Nova. This is planned for V2. For now, you can only gather feedbacks from your visitors.
